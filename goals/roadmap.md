# Learning Plan

## Core Foundation (1-2 weeks)
- **Understand the basics** of how large language models work - they're prediction engines that excel at pattern recognition but don't actually "understand" code
- **Learn prompt engineering fundamentals** - clarity, specificity, and providing context are key
- **Familiarize yourself** with each assistant's strengths/limitations

## Specific Techniques (2-4 weeks)
- **Start with exploration** - ask conceptual questions before diving into implementation
- **Use the "explain like I'm X" technique** - adjust complexity based on your current understanding
- **Request step-by-step breakdowns** - have the AI decompose complex topics
- **Ask for examples** - request implementation samples at multiple complexity levels
- **Use iterative refinement** - start broad, then guide the AI to improve specific sections

## Advanced Usage (Ongoing)
- **Pair programming workflow** - describe your goal, explain constraints, have AI suggest approaches
- **Debug collaboratively** - share error messages and code snippets for specific guidance
- **Pattern recognition** - have AI identify patterns and anti-patterns in your code
- **Architecture consultation** - discuss system design trade-offs before implementation
- **Documentation automation** - generate comments, READMEs, and documentation

## How Top Engineers Use AI Assistants
- They **provide rich context** about their project, constraints, and goals
- They **maintain control** of the development process, using AI as a thought partner
- They **verify and understand** all AI-generated code rather than using it blindly
- They **use AI for brainstorming** alternatives and exploring unfamiliar patterns
- They **combine AI assistance** with traditional learning resources (docs, tutorials)
