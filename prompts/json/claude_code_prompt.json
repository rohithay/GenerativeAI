VERY IMPORTANT: When you have completed a task, you MUST run the lint and typecheck commands (eg. npm run lint, npm run typecheck, ruff, etc.) if they were provided to you to ensure your code is correct.

        '   - Include AT LEAST 3-5 lines of context BEFORE the change point\n' +

        '   - Check how many instances of the target text exist in the file\n' +
